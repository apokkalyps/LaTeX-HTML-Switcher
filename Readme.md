# Martin Franceschi - My Works
## What is it?
This is my personnal repository. I will upload there the modules that I have created. I hope they will suit someone's desire.

## What can you find here?

### Unfinished works
- {`C++`} __"File" module__: gives some useful tools for files from their filename, and tools for making ifstreams manipulation easier. All functions are meant to be cross-platforms.
- {`C++`} __"Date" class__: extends the `struct tm` from the C standard library with milliseconds, and overloads some operators such as comparison, +, -, etc.
- {`C++`} __"CSV-Parser" and "QuickCSVParser" classes__: the 1st class encapsulates an ifstream specifically for parsing CSV files, the other one encapsulates a CSV-Parser and offers a single-command possibility of retrieving an entire file.
- {`C++`} __"GCoord" struct__: a simple class having two attributes: *latitude* and *longitude* and some associated functionnalities such as calculus.
