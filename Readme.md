# Martin Franceschi - My Works
## What is it?
This is my personnal repository. I will upload there the modules that I have created. I hope they will suit someone's desire. Documentation and examples can be found in the **Wiki** section of this repository.

## What can you find here?
- {`C++`} - __"PrimeNumbers"__ - A small Qt-based application for me to discover Qt. Can be easily extended to other functionalities. Read the embedded `Readme.md` for more info about importing it!

### Unfinished works
- {`C++`} - The following libraries:
  - __"File" module__: gives some useful tools for files from their filename, and tools for making ifstreams manipulation easier. All functions are meant to be cross-platforms.
  - __"Date" class__: extends the `struct tm` from the C standard library with milliseconds, and overloads some operators such as comparison, +, -, etc.
  - __"CSV-Parser" and "QuickCSVParser" classes__: the 1st class encapsulates an ifstream specifically for parsing CSV files, the other one encapsulates a CSV-Parser and offers a single-command possibility of retrieving an entire file.
  - __"GCoord" struct__: a simple class having two attributes: *latitude* and *longitude* and some associated functionnalities such as calculus.
